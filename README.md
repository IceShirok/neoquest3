# Neoquest 3

Tinkering with tech to create a full-scale game based on Neoquest.

## Goals

Yes, the tech I'll be throwing at this will be super overengineering. The project's main goal is for me to learn how to use these tools for larger-scale projects; not necessarily to make this efficient off the bat.

* Have a database with fance stuff
* Create a model
* Run it on Docker/Kuubernetes
* Create microservices
* have you, as a pet, interact with the world
* also add a cache
